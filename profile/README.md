## Welcome to Tar Heel Dev Studio! üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Tar Heel Dev Studio is an open source based studio and provides web development, marketing, and design services to small businesses and non-profits. We are located
in the Durham-Chapel Hill area, located in the Triangle Metropolitan area of North Carolina, USA. The company was created in 2022 by Andrew Weisbeck and his fiance Lisa Heusner. Our love of the UNC Tar Heels and the pride we take in being from the North Carolina state where the motto is "to be rather than to seem", and are known as the Tar Heel State. Lower class workers in the naval industry were called "Tar Heels" back in the day, because they would work so damn hard that they would get the pine tar they used to make ships back then, stuck to the bottom of their feet! Pretty cool if you ask me.

The mission is to empower small businesses through innovative software development, design, and marketing solutions, with a vision to become the preferred partner for enhancing digital presence and driving growth. Core values include innovation, customer-centricity, collaboration, and quality. The brand voice is professional yet approachable, inspiring small businesses to reach their full potential. This strategy aims to reflect expertise while remaining accessible, encouraging entrepreneurs to embrace new technologies and improve their operations. The messaging emphasizes a commitment to delivering high-quality services that exceed client expectations, fostering a culture of teamwork and open communication.
